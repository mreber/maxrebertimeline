// my work focuses on this empty mirroring, a feedback loop that eventually distorts and destroys

the distortions become a story when inserted back into social media

This place becomes your reality, it's architectures breathe around you and become you.

solipsism , the space becomes you it's made from you

I was trying to bring my work into physicality, I wanted my selfies to become sculpture. Handheld in close proximity while buldging & fisheyeing towards the viewer. I wanted to look myself in the eye, I wanted the scratchy surface to be felt by the bodies feelers, what does the image feel like on your tongue.

When you talked about NFT's obtaining objecthood, through financial contract, it got me curious and made me feel like I was approaching objecthood wrong and somehow I had fallen short.
