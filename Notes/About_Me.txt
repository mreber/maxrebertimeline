// my work focuses on this empty mirroring, a feedback loop that eventually distorts and destroys

the distortions become a story when inserted back into social media

This place becomes your reality, it's architectures breathe around you and become you.

solipsism , the space becomes you it's made from you

lowkey lowkey 00 0---- i want to make something unpolished


I was trying to bring my work into physicality, I wanted my selfies to become sculpture. Handheld in close proximity while buldging & fisheyeing towards the viewer. I wanted to look myself in the eye, I wanted the scratchy surface to be felt by the bodies feelers, what does the image feel like on your tongue.

When you talked about NFT's obtaining objecthood, through financial contract, by proof of authenticity, it got me curious and made me feel like I was approaching objecthood wrong and somehow I had fallen short.

"funny that u said that the cut soap has no importance when it struck me as important - those cut soaps have no purpose outside of their life as satisfying videos on social media, winning the algorithm for attention is their whole reason for existence. so the relationships ur creating as ur making work abt social media and using the cut soap as a visual form is actually very relevant lol!"

Sweet dream or beautiful nightmare?
