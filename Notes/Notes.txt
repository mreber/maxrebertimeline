In Simulations (1983), Jean Baudrillard
proposed four successive phases of
representation, starting with the indexical
image as a reflection of reality, and ending
with the idea that the image has no
relation to any reality - at which stage it
becomes hyperreal.

Hyperreal

photographic-indexical capturing-of-the-world-we-think-
we-know

mutating reality creatively

social media tools designed for manipulation and modification of behavior

self-as-brand

The Selfie, - empty-mirroring

often enhanced with filters, is posted
for optimal approval in an endless cycle of posting, liking, and gauging popularity. 

//

In this monopolization of users’ attention, now transformed into a meaningless act of sycophantic
adoration, the algorithmic self becomes the unwitting product/object of the platform.

Not only does the fake interaction and empty mirroring ultimately lead to low self-esteem, the branding of
self perpetuates surveillance capitalism. If there is a Baudrillardian (Simulations, 1983) desert of
the real, this would be it.

Social media conditions us to produce fluid adaptable selves, made to maximize herd approval. We become performers for an all-seeing eye, our on-board computer cameras; we are the objects of its patriarchal gaze; in our digital representations we are formed by it. Our ability to adopt an effective, algorithmic internet self seems to be an adaptive requirement, necessary to succeed in an era in crisis, experiencing pandemics and high-speed social change. Selfies are an illustration of the precarious balance between using a new technology and being used by it

ALGORITHMIC SELF
controlled by algorithm, the selfie

Navigable space : an accepted way to visualize all information (3d virtual space, combined with a camera model)

Space becomes a media type

list of seperate objects becomes a coherant 3-d scene

Bizzare hybridization - fluidity - inbetweening of virtuality and reality

dealing with virtuality in terms of afro-futurism conceptual space of embodiment that has a spiritual component theres a thing that happens in halfway spaces that are liminal anthropological term which is about a ritual space of the halfway place 

Liminal is a ritual space

Now it is used in terms of mixed realityies in virtual space, where things seem real, trying to appear real, that mixes at the very least with a human body but visualizes environments

These programs are philosophy, it's languange, the toolset/software is s set of cultural assumptions and each software is based on certain premise

Computer graphic softwares are built on cultural assumptions of representations

All softwares have a philosophy, the camera is a symbol


The softwares become media tropes, cold & sterile

The mistake, the glitch, the hack is where the expression lies within these tools

the question of expression starts to happen

How do you sit on the edge between innovation and expression

half ironic - half serious (manifesto's mostly are)

'Jullian Rosenfelt
Manifesto'

game language unconciously - youre embodied and dissembodied - has a sort of dream like quality // half alive half dead

what is psycho geography - looking at a place in terms of memory & emotion 

what makes a city is velocity, is movement, it is non-linear in time, being able to move around in no real order

when you talk about film , the spine is rigid, and linear,

when you are in a space you are free to wonder, 

psycho-geography / memory is spatial and non-linear and is pplaced ALL OVER in fluid time


a body can be channeled, a body can be a space, architectural, a relationship, has the compacitiy to compete and win, 

glitch femenism // the constructed identity , the constructed self as a liberation

the algorithym feeds you but doesn't help you change, or predict change

“Another term
we adopted to describe some of our problems was ‘glitch.’ Literally, a glitch ...
is such a minute change in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.”15

the idea of the mistake, or the error, an irregular thing within the logocentric system

the mistake is the expressive possibility

glitch is the failure to perform

an AI is simply an averager, it accumulates data and averages it

its good as a research tool because its like a symiotics engine

ai turns information into a cultural trope, 

the internet is a rehearsal space

immersing your afk self and at kyboard self

the glitch , the cyborg, is a monster, its monstrous
