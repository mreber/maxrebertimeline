    <h1 class="title">What is <i>Scorched Earth?</i></h1>
    
    In a literaly sense, the Scorched Earth is a region that once thrived being reduced to a state of barrenness, having lost the capacity for regeneration. To scorch something is not to completely destory or burn something up, its to singe a surface in such a way that color is eradicated. "Color" in this way becomes broader and depics an affect of what gives our life meaning, the connection to the natural world, to eachother, of youth.

    <br>-<br>
    In a capitalistic sense, the Scorched Earth destroys groups of people, it destroys the methods in which communities pursue modes of self-sufficient subsistence, of self-governance or of mutual support.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is our future (arguably our present), the world in decay amongst a dystopic internet landscape.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the stifiling of hope. The disempowerment of youth, the assault on the young. The internet complex being a means to prevent youth from experiencing and knowing itself.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth reveals environmental realities that have been veiled behind the intangibility of wireless setups and systems, the placelessness of data, the illusions of the "virtual", the "cloud." The world vanquishing extremes of the "digital age."
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched earth is the <a href="human.html">human analyzed</a>, every sense, the ticks in the human eye, the frequencies of our breathing. Our humanness as a signal intercepted and commodified.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched earth is the fragmentation of <a href="lifeworld.html">a Lifeworld</a>
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched earth is an <a href="abstractspace.html">Abstract Space</a>

    Hegel's <br> "horizon of autonomy and recognition for everyone" <br> is something social media briefly suggested to fulfill. But as a contruction of capitalism the key fuctions change. Social media instead renders histories unreal and incomprehensible, memory becomes disabled and we absorb lived temporalities.
    <br>-<br>    
    Social significance is attributed to immediacy. We live in an eternity of noisy insignificance, immediate immediately afterwards immediately now experiencing what is happening this second!

    Charles Lyell <br>was widely know for his claim that significant geological changes occured only over immense spans of time.

    He built on the idea of "deep time." Deep time meaning earths history is so vast it cannot be fully experienced by a human lifetime.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is "here to stay." It is permenantley installed.

    The Scorched Earth breathes a <a href="cyberneticparadigm.html">Cybernetic Paradigm</a>
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the homogenization at a level of conciousness. Of digital literacy. The flattening out of human experience devoid of uniqueness.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is a world lived online. If there is to be a liveable world, it will be a world offline.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the idea fed to us that inevitability this is just the way things are. So we should go along with it.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the lack of memory, the lack of understanding of who we are and our histories.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the atomization of cultures into individuals, thereby foreclosing the possibility of collective action.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is our own disposability that is mirrored by our devices. The devices enslave us under the pretext of empowering us.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the global colonization towards a technocratic flattening of infinite accumulation. The internet complex is a new modality of a planetary administration, and aims to maintain the world system as a whole and resist de-colonization.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is a social relation financialized. 
    <br>-<br>
    Crary states that the only hope we have is radical refusal.
