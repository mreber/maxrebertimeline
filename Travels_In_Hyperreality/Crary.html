    <h1 class="title">What is <i>Scorched Earth?</i></h1>
    
    In a literaly sense, the Scorched Earth is a region that once thrived being reduced to a state of barrenness, having lost the capacity for regeneration.
    <br>-<br>
    In a capitalistic sense, the Scorched Earth destroys groups of people, it destroys the methods in which communities pursue modes of self-sufficient subsistence, of self-governance or of mutual support.

    The Scorched Earth is the stifiling of hope. The disempowerment of youth, the assault on the young. The internet complex being a means to prevent youth from experiencing and knowing itself.

    He built on the idea of "deep time." Deep time meaning earths history is so vast it cannot be fully experienced by a human lifetime.

    The Scorched Earth breathes a <a href="cyberneticparadigm.html">Cybernetic Paradigm</a>
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth is the homogenization at a level of conciousness. Of digital literacy. The flattening out of human experience devoid of uniqueness.
