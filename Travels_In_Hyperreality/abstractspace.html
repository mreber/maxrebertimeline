    Abstract Space Is a homogenous zone. 
    <br>-<br>
    Abstract Space is a substrate for which exchange and circulation occurs and global markets depend.
    <br>-<br>
    Before Abstract Space we had forests, vagaries of light, shadows, uncertain distances, and the impenetrable abundance of living matter.
    <br>-<br>
    Historically, Abstract Space is not only a flattened plane, but an environment conquered. Abstract space is supply cut off to an opposing force, an environment that's been eliminated.
    <br>-<br>
    Network architecture is the final Abstract Space. The uprooting and herding of populations all over the world onto the internet, civilians are now permanently target elements.
    <br>-<br>
    Anything unique or resistant being made exchangeable.
    <br>-<br>
    The Scorched Earth reality of abstract space is a world made uninhabitable and unrestorable.
    <br>-<br>
    Simone Weil explained that "uprootedness" was to be denied "real, active and natural participation in the life of a community." She emphasized the idea of having multiple roots in whatever environment you lived, roots that engage one practically
    through work and morally through attentiveness to others.
    <br>-<br>
    Because of a homogeneity of online interactions, we are blind to the uprooting happening around us and become indifferent to the unraveling of the <a href=lifeworld.html>lifeworld</a>. A techno-complacency.
    <br>-<br>
    the "becoming digital" of everything is a hallucination that will perpetuate the disaster of the global present and doom ourselves to inherit Scorched Earth capitalism.
