    Our lives  funnel into protocols of digital networks.
    <br>-<br>
    The humanness we all share, from love, friendship, community, compassions, dissapears or becomes a depleted simulation. Permeated with absence and shallowness.
    <br>-<br>
    There is a colonization of conciousness, the homogenization of experience. Social media as implanted.
    <br>-<br>
    A <a href=lifeworld.html>lifeworld</a> that has been lost is face-to-face assembly, in the eyes of a techno-modernist exchange is no longer important if not producing data that can be extracted and instantly put to use.
    <br>-<br>
    The face-to-face is an immersion, an inhabiting of atmospherics, a meeting of breathing together. It is not occuring in empty space, bounded by frame as we do now.
    <br>-<br>
    The quantified self, the body as knowable, visible, and identifiable. A tracked eye, predicting and manipulating attentiveness. Interaction behaviours.
    <br>-<br>
    "frictionless, effortless, smooth
    magical & meaningful payment experiences" The absence of reflection, thought, or doubt.
    <br>-<br>    
    These streams of stimuli that alter our experience are placed upon us non censensually
    <br>-<br>
    The living face of suffering, the destitute, and the non-white is erased amongst dominant forms of spectacle and celebrity cultures.
    <br>-<br>
    Visions of deep emotional complexities such as loss, sorrow, love, and perserverance do not exist online.
    <br>-<br>
    The complex personhood gone.
