    A lifeworld describes a social rhythm, the alteration of seasons, phases of the moon, migration of birds, the oscillation of day and night, of sleep and waking, the sequence of festivals.
    <br>-<br>
    Social customs and behaviors that derived from an
    interlacing of the human with animals, insects, plants, forests, rivers
    <br>-<br>
    The lifeworld is never private, it is the ongoing life and
work of community, that occurs through what can be talked about with others.
    <br>-<br>
    Lifeworld's only exist in fragments because of the modern idea of dominance over nature, the reality and metaphor of the machine

    Jurgen Habermas argued that language was consitutive of the lifeworld, and was hopeful that new forms of media will support consensus-based communication between "responsible actors." Forty years later we see that an unlikely outcome is close to being realized, with a constant stream of deception, distortion, and programmed unintelligibility and duplicity. [ memes? ]
