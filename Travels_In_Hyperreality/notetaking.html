                            In Simulations (1983), Jean Baudrillard
proposed four successive phases of
representation, starting with the indexical
image as a reflection of reality, and ending
with the idea that the image has no
relation to any reality - at which stage it
becomes hyperreal.

The Selfie, - empty-mirroring

often enhanced with filters, is posted
for optimal approval in an endless cycle of posting, liking, and gauging popularity. 

//
<br>
<br>
In this monopolization of usersâ€™ attention, now transformed into a meaningless act of sycophantic
adoration, the algorithmic self becomes the unwitting product/object of the platform.
<br>
<br>
Not only does the fake interaction and empty mirroring ultimately lead to low self-esteem, the branding of
self perpetuates surveillance capitalism. If there is a Baudrillardian (Simulations, 1983) desert of
the real, this would be it.
<br>
<br>
Social media conditions us to produce fluid adaptable selves, made to maximize herd approval. We become performers for an all-seeing eye, our on-board computer cameras; we are the objects of its patriarchal gaze; in our digital representations we are formed by it. Our ability to adopt an effective, algorithmic internet self seems to be an adaptive requirement, necessary to succeed in an era in crisis, experiencing pandemics and high-speed social change. Selfies are an illustration of the precarious balance between using a new technology and being used by it
